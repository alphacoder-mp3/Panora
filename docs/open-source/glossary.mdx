## Introduction

### The source of truth

The `/packages/shared/src/utils.ts` file contains the most important object of the project which is `providersConfig`.

```ts
export const providersConfig: ProvidersConfig = {
  'crm': {
    'hubspot': {
      scopes: 'crm.objects.contacts.read crm.objects.contacts.write crm.schemas.deals.read crm.schemas.deals.write crm.objects.deals.read crm.objects.deals.write crm.objects.companies.read crm.objects.companies.write crm.objects.owners.read settings.users.read settings.users.write settings.users.teams.read settings.users.teams.write',
      authBaseUrl: 'https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/oauth/authorize',
      logoPath: "https://assets-global.website-files.com/6421a177cdeeaf3c6791b745/64d61202dd99e63d40d446f6_hubspot%20logo.png",
      description: "Sync & Create contacts, deals, companies, notes, engagements, stages, tasks and users",
      apiUrl: 'https://api.hubapi.com',
      customPropertiesUrl: '/properties/v1/contacts/properties',
      authStrategy: AuthStrategy.oauth2
    },
    ....
  },
  'ticketing': {
    'zendesk': {
      scopes: 'read write',
      authBaseUrl: '/oauth/authorizations/new',
      logoPath: 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRNKVceZGVM7PbARp_2bjdOICUxlpS5B29UYlurvh6Z2Q&s',
      description: "Sync & Create accounts, tickets, comments, attachments, contacts, tags, teams and users",
      apiUrl: '/api/v2',
      authStrategy: AuthStrategy.oauth2
    },
    ....
  },
  ....
}
```

where

- `authBaseUrl` is the api endpoint to authorize oauth connections if the provider has `authStrategy` == `AuthStrategy.oauth2`
- `logoPath` is the logo address displayed across Panora
- `apiUrl`is the base api endpoint used
- `authStrategy` is the authentication strategy used, it is of type authStrategy

```ts
export enum AuthStrategy {
  oauth2,
  api_key,
  basic,
}
```

DISCLAIMER: it may be updated in the future if other auth methods are figured out.

### The authentication flow

By default, we focused the core on building the oAuth2 authentication strategy.
But other strategies exist as well.

All utils data could be found inside `/packages/shared/src/envConfig.ts`

The important thing to note is the `type` string variable.

We handle all connections strategies logic in the `packages/api/src/@core/connections-strategies`.

One may want to call either

- `https://${PANORA_API_URL}/connections-strategies/getCredentials` (used to get either custom credentials or default managed panora environment variables as a fallback)
  or
- `https://${PANORA_API_URL}/connections-strategies/createConnectionStrategy` (used in the webapp to let clients add custom connections credentials)

Both endpoints ask for a `type` variable argument which is a `string`.

## IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THE FORMAT CONVENTION IS AS FOLLOWS IN UPPERCASE:

`{PROVIDERNAME}_{VERTICALNAME}_{SOFTWAREMODE}_{AUTHMODE}` where
`PROVIDERNAME` is the name of the provider
`VERTICALNAME` is the vertical the provider belongs to
`SOFTWAREMODE` is the software mode the client wants to run the provider on (onpremise, cloud). By default, set it to `CLOUD`.
`AUTHMODE` is the authentication strategy of the provider (For now we have => OAUTH, API, BASIC)

// i.e HUBSPOT_CRM_CLOUD_OAUTH
// i.e ZENDESK_TICKETING_CLOUD_OAUTH

You'll find this type in .env files, and in some db tables.

### The authentication contributor guide

If you don't see your provider inside the `providersConfig` object within the file `/packages/shared/src/utils.ts` then you may get in touch with Panora team members or build it yourself.

Here are the steps to do so:

# 1. Add the provider metadata to `providersConfig` object

Choose the right vertical and add it given that it has to contain these potential fields:

```ts
export type ProviderConfig = {
  scopes: string;
  authBaseUrl: string;
  logoPath: string;
  description: string;
  active?: boolean;
  apiUrl: string;
  customPropertiesUrl?: string;
  authStrategy?: AuthStrategy;
};
```

If `authStrategy` is not `AuthStrategy.oauth2`, set `authBaseUrl` to blank.

NB: Some providers may use subdomains instead of plain auth api endpoints (i.e https://my_panora_domain/auth)
In this case just write `authBaseUrl: /auth` with a starting `/`.
It is important to start with a `/` as our code use that to detect if subomain is needed across the project.

# 2. Update the construction of the authentication url (used in the frontend)

Modify the `/packages/shared/src/authUrl.ts` file.

Right now we only coded the oAuth2 side so we'll focus on it here.

Update `handleOAuth2Url` function and switch/case found inside if specific params are needed for your provider.

# 3. Generate boilerplate and code the service to build the connection

Now you have to build the connection code inside `/packages/api/@core/src/connections/your_vertical/services`

We have a script that automates all the code + the import across the app.

Run `pnpm run prebuild-oauth-connector --vertical="crm" --provider="hubspot"` for instance.

All imports, dependencies, environment variables are handled.

All you have to do is to check similar services and finish the code.

NB: If your provider needs a subdomain, you have to manually add the environment variable inside the docker-compose and .env .env.example files.
